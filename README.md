# Prime Calculator
Employs the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and a queue data structure to find all prime numbers less than a given number given by user input. Outputs all of such primes. Employs own implementation of a Queue.

The primeCalc class creates a Sieve object that has a .primesTo(int upperBound) function that employs a queue that will pop off any non-prime numbers and ultimately return only prime numbers.
